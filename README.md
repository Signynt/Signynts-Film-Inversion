# Signynt's Darkroom Macro
Signynts-Film-Inversion is a plugin for Affinity Photo that automatically inverts RAW film negative scans, and is capable of using infrared scans for automatic dust removal.

## Requirements

To use the `Split TIFF` workflow you have to have libtiff installed:

`brew install libtiff`

For best results make sure you are using the 'Generic RGB Profile' colorspace in Affinity Photo. You can select it under `Document > Assign ICC profile...`
